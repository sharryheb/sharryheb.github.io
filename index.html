                Born and raised in Fresno, CA, I moved to Redmond, WA in 2002 and have lived in and around the area ever since. I started my professional career at Microsoft, after earning my Masters in Computer Science. I worked at Microsoft as a Software Development Engineer in Test until about a year after my children were born. Once my children came along, I quickly realized that my place was with them, in the home. I proudly raised triplet boys, who are thriving in school and social life. I am ready to get back in the working game!

                My personal interests include playing with my boys, board games, video games, and phone/tablet games. I have taken up pottery as a hobby, and I absolutely love it! I make mostly functional pottery - mugs, bowls, plates, vases, etc, and my biggest "fan" is my mom! Her house is littered with my "failures." :-) One day I hope to be able to set up my own home studio, to continue my study of pottery, as it gives me great joy and is a valuable source of stress relief and meditation for me.
